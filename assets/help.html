	Anonymizer is a general-purpose stand-alone de-identification utility.
	It imports images either from DICOM transfers or from external storage,
	de-identifies them, and stores them in a local file structure.

	<p>The program runs on any computer that has Java 7 or better on it.

	<p>To run the program, either double-click the Anonymizer.jar file or
		launch a command window, navigate to the Anonymizer directory,
		and type:
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar Anonymizer.jar</code>

	<p>If the program reports errors that are not obvious from the
		text shown in the Results pane, you may get additional information
		by running the program in a command window.

	<p>If an out-of-memory error occurs, you may assign more memory to
		the program by running it in a command window with the command:
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -Xmx768m -jar Anonymizer.jar</code>

	<p><b>The Q/R SCU Tab</b>

	<p>The Q/R SCU tab provides control of a DICOM Query/Retrieve SCU for finding
		and importing images via the DICOM protocol from a PACS Q/R SCP. It also lists the
		AE Title used by the SCU for the query. These parameters may be obtained from the
		PACS administrator when the PACS is configured to accept connections from the program.

	<p>Text boxes are supplied for the PatientName, PatientID, and StudyDate
		search fields. At least one search field must contain text for a query to be initiated.
		A blank field is considered a match for anything.
		The <b>Clear</b> button erases the fields.

	<p>When specifying a query, the ? character matches any individual character, and the * character
		matches any sequence of characters. A StudyDate must be specified in full, for example 20190315,
		and wild card characters are not allowed.

	<p>BACKGROUND: A PACS is configured with Application Entity Titles (AE Titles, or AETs)
		for all of the external Service Class Providers (SCPs) and Service Class Users (SCUs) with which
		it interacts. The PACS knows the SCPs and SCUs by their AETs, which it uses to search its
		internal tables for the IP addresses
		and ports of the computers on which they are running. The Anonymizer program contains
		a DICOM Query/Retrieve SCU and a DICOM Storage SCP. When the Anonymizer program retrieves
		images from the PACS, the Q/R SCU tells the PACS to send to the AET of the Storage
		SCP. The PACS uses the IP and port information that it associates with the AET it is given,
		so if your computer's IP address has changed, or if you have changed the SCP's port, the
		transfer will fail. For this reason, if the computer running the Anonymizer program has
		a dynamic IP address, you must configure the PACS to use a domain name for the computer
		so the PACS will be able to get the IP address from a DNS.

	<p><b>The Storage SCP Tab</b>

	<p>The Storage SCP tab provides control of a DICOM Storage SCP for receiving images via
		the DICOM protocol from modalities, workstations, and PACS.

	<p>The header displays the IP address of the SCP and provides a text box
		allowing the port to be specified. It also provides a button for starting
		and stopping the SCP. The <b>Autostart</b> checkbox, if checked, causes the
		program to start the SCP automatically when the program starts. Events are
		logged in the main panel of the tab as images are processed. The <b>Clear</b> button
		erases the panel.

	<p>Processing of images is automatic. The processing is the same as that done
		when images are imported manually using the Directory tab.

	<p><b>The Directory Tab</b>

	<p>The Directory tab has a left and right pane. The left pane provides
		navigation through the files on the computer. The right pane displays
		the results of actions. At the bottom of the right pane, there are buttons
		to initiate the functions provided by the program.

	<p>The pulldown menu in the upper right of the Directory pane allows
		selection of the file system root that will be displayed in the
		directory tree.

	<p>The directory tree does not track changes in the directory structure
		that occur behind the program's back. You can refresh the directory tree
		by clicking the root of the tree or clicking the Refresh button in the header
		of the left pane.

	<p>The button in the lower right of the Directory pane displays a dialog
		that allows selection of the file extensions that are displayed
		in the directory tree. If the list of extensions includes an asterisk,
		all files are displayed. There is a special notation, "[dcm]", that
		selects files whose names contain only numerals and periods. This can
		be used, for example, to select images on DICOM CDs or files that were
		named by their SOPInstanceUIDs.

	<p>The <b>Import</b> button starts the import and de-identification
		process. Which files are processed depends on whether a file or a directory is selected
		in the Directory pane and on whether the <b>Include subdirectories</b> checkbox
		is selected:
	<ul>
		<li>If a single file is selected, that file is processed.</li>
		<li>If a directory is selected and the <b>Include subdirectories</b> checkbox is
			not selected, all the files in the selected directory are processed, but no
			files in subdirectories are processed.</li>
		<li>If a directory is selected and the <b>Include subdirectories</b> checkbox is
			selected, all the files in the selected directory and all its subdirectories
			are processed.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Events that occur during the anonymization process are logged in the Results pane.

	<p>Images are stored in file structures for each date of processing. The file structures
		are stored in a parent directory. By default, the parent directory is called Submissions, and it
		is located in the directory containing the program. To change the parent directory, click the
		<b>Set Storage Directory</b> button, navigate to the desired directory, and click <b>Save</b>.
		The currently selected output directory is shown in the header of the right pane. Clicking that text
		repositions the directory tree in the left pane to point to the submissions directory.

	<p><b>The Export Tab</b>

	<p>The Export tab lists the patients in the storage directory tree. It provides two means of export:
		HTTP and DICOM. Switching between the two protocols is accomplished by clicking the <b>Switch to...</b>
		button in the lower left corner of the window. The selected export protocol must be configured in the
		header of the pane.

	<p>For HTTP, enter the IP address (or domain name) of the destination and the port. Do not include the
		name of the protocol. Do not include any path information.

	<p>For DICOM, you must register with the administrator of the destination SCP and set the fields in
		the header.

	<p>Once configured, check the boxes of the patients to be exported and click the <b>Export</b> button
		in the footer. As patients are transmitted, the date is entered in the ExportDate column and the checkbox
		is cleared. The <b>Select All</b> button in the footer checks the boxes of all patients that have not been
		exported.

	<p><b>The Admin Tab</b>

	<p>The Admin tab displays additional tabs for viewing images and DICOM elements, for configuring the filter
		and anonymizer scripts, and for searching or displaying the patient index.

	<p><b>The Viewer Tab</b>

	<p>The Viewer tab displays the currently selected DICOM image. If the image file contains multiple frames,
		the <b>Next Frame</b> and <b>Previous Frame</b> buttons sequence through
		the frames. Frame sequencing is also provided through the mouse wheel.

	<p>Zoom, pan, and window width and level
		functions are provided through icons in the upper right of the window.

	<p>The window width and level can also
		be set manually by typing values into the provided text boxes. When entering text in the window width and level
		boxes, the values do not take effect until the Enter key is pressed.

	<p>The <b>Save As JPEG</b> button saves the image, reduced to the width specified in a popup dialog.

	<p><b>The Elements Tab</b>

	<p>The Elements tab displays the element contents of the selected DICOM image.

	<p><b>The Filter Tab</b>

	<p>To be accepted for import and processing, a file must be a DICOM image. It must also match a filter script
		as described in http://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=The_CTP_DICOM_Filter.

	<p>The Filter tab provides an editing window for creating or modifying the filter script. Any text changes
		in the window are immediately active, but they are not saved until the Save button is clicked. The Refresh
		button
		discards any unsaved changes and reloads the filter text from the last saved version.

	<p>The Filter tab has three checkboxes in its footer:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Remove Structured Report Files</b> is selected by default. If selected, the filter does not accept SR
			objects. Since SR objects
			generally contain PHI in hard-to-find places, this is the safe option.</li>
		<li><b>Remove Secondary Capture Files</b> is selected by default. If selected, the filter does not accept
			secondary capture objects.
			Since these objects often contain PHI burned into the pixels, this is the safe option.</li>
		<li><b>Accept Reformatted Images</b> is selected by default. If selected, the filter accepts secondary capture
			objects if
			they are reformatted images, even if Remove Secondary Capture Files is selected. Since reformatted image
			files generally
			do not contain PHI burned into the pixels, this is generally safe.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>The Script Tab</b>

	<p>The DICOM de-identification process is driven by a script file called "dicom-anonymizer.script" located in the
		directory
		containing the program. A default version is included in the installation.

	<p>The Script tab displays the DICOM anonymizer scripts. You can edit the scripts and click the <b>Save Changes</b>
		button.
		Changes are not effective until the scripts are saved. If you make a change and decide you made an error
		before saving, click the <b>Reset</b> button and the scripts will be refreshed from the last saved version.

	<p>The DICOM anonymizer script functions are documented in
		http://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=The_CTP_DICOM_Anonymizer.

	<p>Before beginning to import and process images, the first item in the script should be updated to reflect the site
		identifier (SITEID). Unless special de-identification rules are required by the project, no other parts of the
		script
		need be modified.

	<p><b>The Index Tab</b>

	<p>The Index tab provides an interface for searching the index of files that have been anonymized and stored in
		the directory tree of submissions. The index is persistent, so it contains information on every patient
		processed
		by the program. To find the original PatientName and PatientID for a study subject, enter the anonymized
		PatientName
		in the search field and type the Enter key or click the <b>Search</b> button. The search field is not case
		sensitive.

	<p>To list the entire index, click the <b>List</b> button. When in the List pane, the <b>Save</b> button saves the
		index
		in a spreadsheet file, including study information.

	<p><b>The Log Tab</b>

	<p>The Log tab lists events logged by various components in the program. The log may be useful in initial setup, as
		the
		configuration is tested before production use.
