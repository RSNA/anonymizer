	<!-- <h1 style="text-align: center;">RSNA DICOM Anonymizer Overview</h1> -->

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		The RSNA DICOM Anonymizer is a cross platform, stand-alone de-identification utility.
		DICOM image files are imported either via network transfers or directly from the local file system.
		When a DICOM file is received, it is de-identified and then stored in a user-defined local storage directory.
		Anonymized images can be exported either to a remote DICOM server or an AWS S3 Object store such as the RSNA Imaging Archive.
		</p>

	<h2>Design Guidelines</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Open Source</li>
		<li>Stand-alone GUI written in Python 3</li>
		<li>No internet connection required</li>
		<li>Suitable for users with limited DICOM knowledge who are keen to curate and submit medical imaging datasets for AI model development</li>
		<li>Platforms supported: Windows, OSX (Intel & ARM), Linux platforms</li>
		<li>Ongoing development, build processes and release distribution via RSNA public github account</li>
		<li>Backward compatible with Java version</li>
		<li>PACS, Cloud PACS and VNA compatible</li>
		<li>Reflect all errors to user, do not rely on log analysis</li>
		<li>Project based with centralized settings management</li>
		<li>Model, View, Controller (MVC) software architecture</li>
		<li>Handle up to 10 million images per project</li>
		<li>Anonymize 10 files per second</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Previous Java Anonymizer</h2>
		<p>This version of the Anonymizer is based on the Medical Imaging Resource Centre (MIRC) Clinical Trial Processor (CTP)
			<a href="https://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=The_MIRC_DICOM_Anonymizer">Java Anonymizer V16</a></p>
		<h4>Differences from Java Version</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Written in Python for Version 3.11</li>
			<li>Implements operation subset to handle the default anonymizer script: {@remove, @empty, @hashdate, @round, ptid, acc, uid}</li>
			<li>Fields with ptid in the operation will be replaced by a sequentially generated Patient ID starting at 1</li>
			<li>Fields with acc in the operation will be replaced by a sequentially generated Accession Number starting at 1</li>
			<li>Fields with uid in the operation will be replaced by a sequentially generated UID of form {UIDRoot.SiteID.N} N = 1,2,3...</li>
			<li>No built-in editor for anonymizer script</li>
			<li>No filter script, uses DICOM association contexts to restrict which storage classes & transfer syntaxes are imported</li>
			<li>No internal DICOM image viewer</li>
			<li>No internal log viewer</li>
			<li>Project based: multiple separate projects with sand boxed settings can be created and managed on same machine</li>
			<li>Project defines allowed modalities, storage classes, transfer syntaxes, network timeouts and logging levels</li>
			<li>Simplified DICOM client & server configuration</li>
			<li>Incoming files are not written to a temporary local disk directory for delayed processing; instead they are kept in memory queue.</li>
			<li>Export to AWS S3 Object Store with AWS Cognito user authentication</li>
			<li>Create Patient Lookup / Index in csv format with Number of Series and Number of Instances appended to each study row</li>
			<li>Allows concurrent import and export processes</li>
			<li>Provides a reliable study retrieval method at all levels (Study, Series, Instance) to handle remote DICOM servers which implement asynchronous C-MOVE (eg. VNA)</li>
			<li>Fast in-memory datastore for Anonymizer Data Model</li>
		</ol>
